Civil Appeal No.94 of 1949 . 107 834 Appeal from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Judi cature at Patna in Appeal from Appellate Decree No . 97 of 1946 ( Mannohar Lall and Mukherji JJ . ) dated 23rd Decem ber , 1947 , confirming the judgment of the District Judge of Purulia in Appeal No . 159 of 1944 . S.P . Sinha ( P. K. Bose , with him ) for the appel lant . N.C. Chatterjee and Panchanan Ghosh ( Chandra Narayan Naik , with them ) for the respondent . 1950 . December 1 . The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by PATANJALI SASTRI J . This appeal arises out of a suit brought by the respondent in the court of the Subordinate Judge , Dhanbad , for recovery of arrears of royalty and cess from the appellant and another alleged to be due under a compromise decree passed on the 6th March , 1923 , in a previ ous suit between the predecessors in interest of the par ties . The only plea which is material for the purpose of this appeal is that the compromise decree not having been registered was inadmissible in evidence . The courts below held that the document did not require registration and gave effect to its terms in decreeing the suit . The second defendant has preferred this appeal . The facts are not now in dispute and may be briefly stated . On 11th March , 1921 , one Kumar Krishna Prasad Singh ( hereinafter referred to as Kumar ) granted a perma nent lease of the right to the underground coal in 5,800 bighas of land belonging to him to Shibsaran Singh and Sitaram Singh ( hereinafter referred to as the Singhs ) by a registered patta stipulating for a salami of Rs . 8,000 and royalty at the rate of 2a . per ton of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs . 8,000 and for certain other cesses and interest . On 7th June , 1921 , Kumar executed another perma nent patta leasing the right to the coal in 500 bighas out of the 5,800 bighas referred to above to one Prayngji Bal lavji Deoshi and his son Harakchand Deoshi ( hereinafter referred to as the Deoshis ) . By this document . 835 the Deoshis agreed inter alia to pay royalty at the rate of 2a . per ton on all classes of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs . 750 a year . The Singhs feeling themselves aggrieved by the latter transaction brought a title suit ( No . 1291 of 1921 ) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhanbad for a declaration of their title and for possession of the 500 bighas leased to the Deoshis under the aforesaid patta of 7th June , 1921 . To that suit Kumar was made a party as defendant No . 3 , the Deoshis being defendants 1 and 2 . The suit was however cornpromised on 6th March , 1923 , by all the parties and a decree based on the compromise was also passed on the same day . The interest of the Singhs was brought to sale in 193S in execution of a decree obtained against them and was purchased by the plaintiff who insti tuted the presnt suit on 3rd October , 1942 , claiming the royalty and cesses payable under the compromise decree for the period from Pous 1345 to Asadh 1349 B.S . from defendants 1 and 2 as the representatives of the Deoshis who entered into the compromise of March , 1923 . In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties , it is necessary to set out the relevant terms of the compro mise decree which are as follows : `` The plaintiffs ( the Singhs ) within two months from this date shall pay Rs . 8,000 as salami to defendant No . 3 ( Kumar ) . Otherwise all the terms of the compromise Will stand cancelled and the plaintiffs shall not be competent to claim any right to or possession over the.land covered by the patta dated 11th March , 1921 . The patta which defend ant No . 3 executed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of 5,800 bighas of coal land in village Rahraband shall remain in force , and the plaintiffs will get a decree of declara tion of their right and title to the 500 bighas of coal land in dispute but defendants 1 and 2 ( the Deoshis ) shall hold possession as tenants . Besides the terms mentioned below , defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound by all the remaining terms under which they took settlement of the 500 bighas of coal land from defendant No . 3 under 836 patta and Kabuliyat , and both the defendants 1 and 2 shall possess the same under the plaintiffs from generation to generation and all the terms of the said patta and Kabuliyat shall remain effective and in force between them . Both the defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound to pay to the plain tiffs commission at the rate of 2a . per ton on all sorts of coal instead of 2a . a ton as stated before in the patta of 5,800 bighas of land settled with the plaintiffs . The plaintiffs shall pay to defendant No . 3 in future the mini mum royalty of Rs . 6,000 instead of Rs . 8,000 as stipulated in the original patta of 11 th March 1921 and commission at the rate of la . a ton in place of 2a . a ton as stipulat ed in the patta of March 21 . Unless the plaintiffs pay to the defendant No . 3 Rs . 8,000 within 2 months from this day they shall not be competent to take out execution of
