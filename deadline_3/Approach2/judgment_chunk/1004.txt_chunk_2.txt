in the premises occupied by him could ordinarily be used for the manufacture of toddy . We are accordingly satisfied that there was no prejudice caused to the appellant , in the circumstances of the present case , when the High Court relied upon the presumption arising under section 103 522 to uphold his conviction under section 65 ( f ) of the Act . It was finally urged that the sentence should be reduced . In our opinion , the sentence imposed can not be said to be unduly severe having regard to the provisions of the Act . Accordingly , the appeal of appellant No . 2 is allowed and his conviction and sentence are set aside but the appeal of appellant No . 1 is dismissed . Appeal disposed of accordingly .
