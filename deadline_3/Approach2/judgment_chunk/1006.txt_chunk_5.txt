is clear on those terms that there is no right reserved to the contractors to return the goods at any time that they found it convenient or necessary . On the other hand , they were bound to pay two thirds of the total approximate price fixed by the parties in equal instalments . The Contractors were not bound under the terms to return any of the machinery or the equipments , nor was the Corporation bound to take them back unconditionally . The term in the agreement regarding the `` taking over '' of the machinery or equipments by the Corporation on payment of the `` residual value '' is wholly inconsistent with a contract of mere hiring and is more consistent with the property in the goods having passed to the Contractors , subject to the payment of all the instalments of the purchase pride . Furthermore , the stipulation that the Contractors themselves will have to supply the spare parts , as and when needed , for replacements of the worn out parts is also consistent with the case of the respondent that title had passed to the contractors and that they were responsible for the upkeep of the machinery and equipments and for depreciation . If it were a mere contract of hiring , the owner of the goods would have continued to be liable for replacements of worn out parts and for depreciation . Applying those tests to the terms of the agreement between the parties , it is clear that the transaction was a sale on deferred payments with an option to repurchase and not a mere contract of hiring , as contended on behalf of the appellant . It must , therefore , be held that the judgment of the High Court is entirely correct and the appeal must be dismissed with costs . Appeal dismissed .
