and can be no different in pith and substance from a tax on goods produced which comes under Item 84 of List I , as duty of excise . The present levy therefore under section 4 of the Act can not be justified as a tax on mineral rights . In the view I have taken , it is not necessary to consider the other point , raised on behalf of the petitioners , namely , that even if it is a fee , in view of the two Central Acts ( mentioned earlier ) the , Orissa Legislature was not competent to pass the Act . I would 584 therefore allow the petition , and declare that the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act , 1952 , is beyond the constitutional competence of the Orissa Legislature to pass it . The whole Act must be struck down because there will be very little left in the Act if section 4 falls as it must . The legislature would never have passed the Act without section 4 . By COURT . In accordance with the majority Judgment of the Court , the Writ Petition is dismissed with costs .
