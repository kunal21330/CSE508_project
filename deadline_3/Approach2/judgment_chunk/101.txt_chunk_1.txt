Subba Rao , J. delivered a dissenting Opinion . GAJENDRAGADKAR , J . This group of 26 criminal appeals has been placed for hearing and disposal before a special Constitutional Bench , because the appeals constituting the group raise two common important questions of Constitutional law . Nine of these appeals have been preferred against the decisions of the Punjab High Court , whereas seventeen have been preferred against the decisions of the Bombay High Court . All the appellants are detenues who have been detained respectively by the Punjab and the Maharashtra State Governments under Rule 30 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Defence of India Rules ( hereinafter called the Rules ) made by the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred on it by section 3 of the Defence of India Ordinance , 1962 ( No . 4 of 1962 ) ( hereinafter called the Ordinance ) . They applied to the Punjab and the Bombay High Courts respectively under section 491 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and alleged that they had been improperly and illegally detained . Their contention was that section 3 ( 2 ) ( 15 ) ( 1 ) and section 40 of the Defence 806 of India Act , 1962 ( No . 51 of 1962 ) ( hereinafter called 'the Act ' ) and Rule 36 ( 1 ) ( b ) under which they have been detained are constitutionally invalid , because they contravene their fundamental rights under Articles 14 , 21 and 22 ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) & ( 7 ) of the Constitution , and so , they claimed that an order should be passed in their favour directing the respective State Governments to set them at liberty . These petitions have been dismissed on the ground that the Presidential Order which has been issued under article 359 of the Constitution creates a bar which precludes them from moving the High Court under section 491 ( 1 ) ( b ) Cr . That is how the decisions of the two High Courts under appeal raise two common questions of considerable importance . The first question is : what is the true scope and effect of the Presidential Order which has been issued under article 359 ( 1 ) ? The answer to this question would depend upon a fair and reasonable construction of article 359 ( 1 ) itself . The second question is : does the bar created by the Presidential Order issued under article 359 ( 1 ) operate in respect of applications made by detenues under section 491 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Code ? The answer to this question would depend upon the determination of the true character of the proceedings which the detenues have taken under section 491 ( 1 ) ( b ) , considered in the light of the effect of the Presidential Order issued under article 359 ( 1 ) . Both the Punjab and the Bombay High Courts have held against the appellants . Meanwhile , when similar petitions were made before the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Cases Nos . 1618 , 1759 and 1872 of 1963 Sher Singh Negi vs District Magistrate , Kanpur & Anr. , the said High Court took a contrary view and directed the release of the detenues who had moved it under section 491 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Code . It is because the questions raised are important and the answers given by the different High Courts have disclosed a sharp difference of opinion that a Special Bench has been constituted to deal with these appeals . If the two principal questions are answered in favour of the detenues , a third question would arise and that relates to the validity of the impugned sections of the Act and the relevant statutory Rules . On the 8th September , 1962 , the Chinese aggressively attacked the northern border of India and that constituted a threat to the security of India . That is why on 807 the 26th October , 1962 , the President issued a Proclamation under article 352 of the Constitution . This Proclamation declared , that a grave emergency existed whereby the security of India was threatened by external aggression . On the same day , the Ordinance was promulgated by the President . This Ordinance was amended by Ordinance No . 6 of 1962 promulgated on November 3 , 1962 . On this day , the President issued the Order under article 359 ( 1 ) , suspending the rights of citizens to move any Court for the enforcement of the rights conferred by articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution for the period during which the proclamation of emergency issued on October 26 , 1962 would be in force . On November 6 , 1962 , the rules framed by the Central Government were published . Then followed an amendment of the Presidential Order on November 11 1962 . By this amendment , for the words and figures `` article 21 '' the words and figures `` articles 14 and 21 ''
