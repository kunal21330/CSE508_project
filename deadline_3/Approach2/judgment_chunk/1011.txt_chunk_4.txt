extinguished and the land became free from land revenue , assessment in perpetuity . It can not thereafter be said that the land was still assessed to land revenue . Mr. Mitra made a great effort to construe the operative part quoted above with the aid of the recital in the deed , where it was stated : `` . but free and discharged from all payment of land revenue , land tax and all and every tax or imposition in the nature of revenue derivable from land payable to Government . He drew attention to the word 'payment ' , and contended that what was saved was payment of land revenue . He argued that in case of ambiguity it was permissible to construe the operative portion of a deed in the light of the recitals , and cited Halsbury 's Laws of England , 3rd Edn. , Vol . XI , p. 421 , para . 680 , Gwyn vs Neath Canal Co. ( 1 ) and Orr vs Mitchell ( 2 ) . If there was any ambiguity in the operative portion of the deed , we may have taken the aid of the recitals . But there is no ambiguity in the deed . The history of redemption is a matter of record , and it is plain that Government was accepting a down payment and freeing land from land revenue . This is precisely what was done , and the result of the down payment is set out with great clarity in the deed itself , and it is that there was no land revenue assessed on or demandable from that land . In fact , no demand or payment or charge in the nature of land revenue could ever be made on it . In view of this , it is , in our judgment , quite satisfactorily established that this land was not assessed to land revenue and the income from it did not fall within section 2 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Income tax Act . The answer given by the High Court was thus correct . In the result , the appeal fails , and will be dismissed with costs . ( 1868 ) L R. Appeal dismissed ( 2 ) , 254 .
