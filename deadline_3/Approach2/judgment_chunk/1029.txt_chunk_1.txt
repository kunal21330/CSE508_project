repealed or anything duly done thereunder or affect any right , obligation or liability acquired , accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed . It further provides that any legal proceedings may be continued or enforced as if the repealing Act had not been passed . Now , if the amending Act had repealed the original section 34 , and merely enacted a new section in its place , the repeal might not have affected the operation of the original section by virtue of section 6 . But the amending Act goes further than this . It ( 1 ) ; ( 2 ) ( 3 ) 764 repeals the original section 34 , not from the day on which the Act received the assent of the Governor General but from a stated day , viz. , March 30 , 1948 , and substitutes in its place another section containing the proviso above mentioned . The amending Act provides that the amending section shall be deemed to have come into force on March 30 , 1948 , and thus by this retrospectivity , indicates a different intention which excludes the application of section 6 . It is to be noticed that the notices were all issued on August 8 , 1948 , when on the statute book must be deemed to be existing an enactment enjoining a duty upon the Income tax Officer to obtain prior approval of the Commissioner , and unless that approval was obstained , the notices could not be issued The notice were thus invalid . , The principle which was applied by this Court in Venkatachalam vs Bombay Dyeing & Mfg . Co. Ltd. ( 1 ) is equally applicable here . No question of law was raised before us , as it could not be in view of the decision of this Court in Narayana Chetty vs Income tax Officer ( 2 ) , that the proviso was not mandatory in character . Indeed , there was time enough for fresh notices to have been issued , and we fail to see why the old notices were not recalled and fresh ones issued . For these reasons , we are in agreement with the High , Court in the answers given , and dismiss this appeal with costs . A appeal dismissed .
