No . 2205 of 1946 47 . C. K. Daphtary , Solicitor General for India , ( K. T. Desai and A.M. Mehta , with him ) for the appellant . M. C. Setalvad , Attorney General for India , ( G. N. Joshi , with him ) for the respondent . November 3 . The Judgment of the Court , Was delivered by Bose , J . This is an appeal from the High Court at Bombay in an Income tax Reference under section 66 ( 1 ) of the Indian Income tax Act of 1922 . The reference was made to the Bombay High Court by the Bombay Bench of the Income tax Appellate Tribunal in the following circumstances . The appellant assessee is a company known its the Raghuvanshi Mills Ltd. , of Bombay . The assessment year with which we are concerned is 1945 46 . 'The assessee had insured its buildings , plant and machinery with various insurance companies and also took out , besides those policies , four policies of a type known as a `` Consequential Loss Policy. '' This kind of policy insures against loss of profit , standing charges and agency commission . The total insured against under , the latter heads was Rs . 37,75,000 account of loss.of profits and standing charges , and Rs . 2,26,000 account of agency commission , making a total of Rs . 40,00,000 . On the 18th of January , 1944 , a fire . broke out and the mill were completely destroyed . The various insurance companies therefore paid the assessee company an aggregate of Rs . 14,00,000 account in the year with which we are concerned under these policies . This was paid in two sums as follows : Rs . 8,25,0.00 8th September , 1944 , and Rs . 5,75,000 22nd December , 1944 . These payments have been treated as part of the assessee 's 'income and the 179 company has been taxed accordingly . The question is whether these sums are or are not liable to tax . Before we set out the question referred , it will be necessary to state that the whole of this Rs . 14,00 , 000 has been treated as paid account of loss of profits . The learned Solicitor General , who appeared for the ) appellant assessee , contended that that was wrong because the portion of it assignable to standing charges and agency commission could not any construction be liable to tax . This contention is new and involves questions of fact and travels beyond the scope ' of the question referred . We are consequently not , able to entertain it . It has been assumed throughout the proceedings , tight up to this Court , that the whole of the Rs . 14,00,000 was assignable to loss of profits . There is nothing the record to show that it was ever split up among the other heads or that it was ever treated & a having been split up , either by the insurance com panies or by the assessee , nor is there any material which we would be able to apportion it . Our decision therefore proceeds the assumption that the whole sum is assignable to loss of profits and we make it clear that we 'decide nothing about other moneys which may be distributable among other heads . The question has been referred in these terms : `` Whether in the circumstances of the case , the sum of Rs . 14,00,000 was the assessee company 's income within the meaning of Section 2 ( 6C ) of the Indian Income tax Act and liable to pay income tax under the Indian Income tax Act. '' We are concerned in this case with four policies of insurance with four different insurance companies . The clauses relevant to the present matter are the same in all four cases though the sum insured against by . each insurance company differs . They are as follows `` POLICY NO . C.L . 110018. . . 180 Rupees X Lacs only Loss of Profits , Standing Charges and Agency Commission of the above Co. 's Mills , situate at Haines o Road , Mahaluxmi ; Bombay , following . . The total amount declared for insurance is Rs . 40,00,000 and for 18 months ' benefits only as under : Rs . 37,75,000 Loss of Profits and Standing Charges . Rs . 2,25,000 Agency Commission . Rs . 40,00,000 Out , of which this policy covers Rs . X lacs only . Schedule attached to and forming part of Po licy No . C. L. 10018 . The company will pay to the assured : The loss of Gross Profit due to ( a ) Reduction in Output and ( b @ ) increase in Cost of Working and the , amount payable as indemnity hereunder shall . . Definitions of those two terms follow . We need not reproduce talent . Then come the following definitions : `` Gross profit . The sum produced by adding to the Net Profit the amount of the Insured Standing Charges , or if there be no Net Profit the amount of the Insured Standing Charges , less such a proportion of any net trading loss as the amount of the Insured Standing Charges bears to all the Standing Charges of the business .
