a `` profit '' and so is not taxable [ B. C. Fir and Cedar Lumber Co. vs The King ( 1 ) ] . But the Court did not examine the wider position whether it is `` income '' and in any event the decision was reversed appeal to the Privy Council ( 1 ) . Their Lordships held it is `` income '' . This was followed later by the Court of Appeal in England and endorsed by the House of Lords in Commissioners of inland Revenue vs William 's Executors ( 1 ) In so far as these decisions do not turn the special wording of the Acts with which they are respectively concerned and deal with the more general meaning of the word `` income '' , we prefer the view taken in England . It is true the Judicial Committee attempted a narrower definition in Commissioner of income tax vs Shaw Wallace & Co. ( 1 ) , by limiting income to `` a periodical monetary return 'coming in ' with some sort of regularity , or expected regularity , from definite sources '' but , in our opinion , those remarks must be ( I ) [ 1931 ] Canada L.R . 435 . ( 2 ) [ I932 ] A. C. 441 at 448 . ( 3 ) ( I944 ) ( 4 ) ( 1932 ) 59 I.A . 206 . 184 read with reference to the particular facts of that case . The non recurring aspect of this kind of receipt was considered by the Privy Council in The King vs B. C. Fir and Cedar Lumber Co. ( 1 ) , and we do not think $ their Lordships had in mind a case of this nature when they decided Shaw Wallace & Company 's case ( 2 ) . The learned Solicitor General relies strongly a clause which appears in three of the four policies with which we are concerned . That is a clause which states that the insured must do all he can to minimise the loss in profits and until he makes an endeavour to re start the business the moneys will not be paid . This , he argued , shows that the money was paid as an indemnity against the loss of profits and was niether income nor profits , nor was it a gain within the meaning of the section . We are unable to see how these receipts cease to be income simply because certain things must be done before the moneys can be claimed . In our opinion , the High Court was right in holding that the Rs . 14,00,000 is assessable to tax . The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs . Appeal dismissed .
