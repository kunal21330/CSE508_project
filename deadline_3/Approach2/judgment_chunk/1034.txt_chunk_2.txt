that a tax can not be struck down as discriminatory unless the Court finds that it has been imposed with a deliberate intention of differentiating between an individual and an individual or upon grounds of race , religion , creed , language or the like . There was no question of doing anything like this in the year 1946 when no other sugar factory existed in the State of Gwalior . The cess was thus good in law when enacted and it has not been rendered void under article 13 by reason of the coming into force of the Constitution on the ground that it violates article 14 . In our opinion , therefore , both the grounds on which the validity of the cess is challenged are ill conceived and the cess is a perfectly valid one . It would , therefore , be competent to the State of Madhya Pradesh to realise that cess from the respondent factory . Upon the view we have taken in the matter in C. A . No . 98 of 1957 nothing remains to be considered in C. A . No . 99 of 1957 . Accordingly we allow the appeal by the State and dismiss that of the respondents . The costs of the appeal will be borne by the respondents in C. A . No . 98 of 1957 . As both the appeals were argued together , there will be only one set of hearing fees . Appeal No . 98 allowed . Appeal No . 99 dismissed .
