The Judgment of the Court was delivered by section K. DAS , J . These three writ petitions have been heard together , as they raise common questions of law and fact . They relate , however , to three different enactments made by the Legislatures of three different States Bihar in writ petition No . 15 , Uttar Pradesh in writ petition No . 21 , and Madhya Pradesh in writ petition No . 14 . The petitioners in the several petitions have challenged the 'validity of a number of provisions of the enactments in question and , in some cases , also of the rules made thereunder . The impugned provisions are similar in nature , but are not exactly the same . Therefore , we shall first state in general terms the case of the petitioners and then consider in detail and separately the impugned provisions in each case . But before we do so , it is necessary to refer to some background history of the legislation under consideration in these cases . In the year 1958 this Court had to consider the validity of certain provisions of three Acts : ( 1 ) The Bihar Preservation and Improvement of Animals Act , ( Bihar Act II of 1956 ) ; ( 2 ) the Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act , 1955 ( U. P. Act 1 of 1956 ) ; and ( 3 ) the Central Provinces and Berar Animal Preservation Act , 1949 ( C. P. and Berar Act LII of 1949 ) . The Bihar Act put a total ban on the slaughter of all 613 categories of animals of the species of bovine cattle . The U. P. Act put a total ban on the slaughter of cows and her progeny which included bulls , bullocks , heifers and calves . The C. P. and Berar Act placed a total ban on the slaughter of cows , male or female calves of cows , bulls , bullocks , and heifers , and the slaughter of buffaloes ( male or female , adults or calves ) was permitted only under a certificate granted by the proper authorities . These three Acts were enacted in pursuance of the directive principle of State policy contained in article 48 of the Constitution . The petitioners who challenged the various provisions of the aforesaid Acts in 1958 were engaged in the butcher 's trade and its subsidiary undertakings ; they challenged the constitutional validity of the Acts on the ground that they infringed their fundamental rights under articles 14 , 19 ( 1 ) ( f ) and ( g ) of the Constitution . In the decision which this Court gave in Mohd . Hanif Quareshi vs The State , of Bihar ( 1 ) , it held ( i ) that a total ban on the slaughter of cows of all ages and calves of cows and of she buffaloes , male or female , was quite reasonable and valid ; ( ii ) that a total ban on the slaughter of she buffaloes or breeding bulls , or working bullocks ( cattle as well as buffaloes ) so long as they were capable of being used as milch or draught cattle was also reasonable and valid ; and ( iii ) that a total ban on slaughter of she buffaloes , bulls and bullocks ( cattle or buffalo ) after they ceased to be capable of yielding milk or of breeding or working as draught animals was not in the interests of the general public and was invalid . In the result this Court directed the respondent States not to enforce their respective Acts in so far as they were declared void by it . This led to some amending or new legislation , and we are concerned in these three cases with the provisions of these amending or new Acts and the rules made thereunder . In Bihar ( Writ Petition No . 15 of 1959 ) the impugned Act is called the Bihar Preservation and Improvement of Animals ( 1 ) ; 78 614 ( Amendment ) Act , 1959 which received the assent of the Governor on January 13 , 1959. in Uttar Pradesh ( Writ Petition No . 21 of 1959 ) the impugned Act is called the Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Cow Slaughter ( Amendment ) Act , 1958 and in Madhya Pradesh ( Writ Petition No ' 14 of 1960 ) a new Act was passed called the Madhya Pradesh Agricultural Cattle Preservation Act , 1959 ( Act 18 of 1959 ) which received the assent of the President on July 24 , 1959 and came into force on January 15 , 1960 . The rules made there under are called the Madhya Pradesh Agricultural Cattle Preservation Rules , 1959 . The general case of the petitioners , who are several in number in each of
