The judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J . These are two cross appeals from the decision of the High Court at Calcutta in its appellate jurisdiction dated 17th February , 1947 , modifying the order of the Subordinate Judge of Howrah in Title Execution Case No . 68 of 1936 . The litigation culminating in these appeals comnmenced about thirty years ago . In the year 1923 , one Durga Prasad Chamria instituted a suit against the respondents , Radha Kissen Chamria , Motilal Chamria and their mother Anardevi Sethan ( since deceased ) for specific performance of an agreement , 139 for sale of an immoveable property in Howrah claiming a sum of Rs . 11,03,063 8 3 and other reliefs . The suit , was eventually decreed compromise the 19th April , 1926 . Under the compromise decree the plaintiff became entitled to a sum of Rs . 8,61,000 from the respondents with interest at 61 per cent . with yearly rests from the date fixed for payment till realization . Part of the decretal sum was payable the execution of the solenama and the rest by instalments within eighteen months of that date . Within fifteen months from the date of the decree a sum of Rs . 10,00,987 15 6 is said to have been paid towards satisfaction of it . No steps were taken either by the judgment debtors or the decre holder regarding certification of most of those payments within the time prescribed by law . The judgment debtors after the expiry of a long time made an application for certification but the decree holder vehemently resisted it and declined to 'admit the payments . The result was that the court only recorded the payment of the last three instalments which had been made within ninety days before the application and the judgmentdebtors had to commence a regular suit against the decree holder for recovery of the amounts paid , and not admitted in the execution proceedings . In the year 1929 a decree was passed in favour of the judgment debtors for the amount paid by them and not , certified in the execution . In the meantime the decree holder had realized further amounts in execution of the decree by taking out execution proceedings two or three occasions . The amount for which a decree had been passed against the decree holder was also thereafter adjusted towards the amount duo under ' the consent decree . On the 17th March , 1933 , the decree was assigned by Durga Prasad to the appellant Keshardeo Chamria . The execution proceedings out of which these appeals arise were started by the assignee the 10th October , 1936 , for the realization of Rs . 4,20,693 8 9 and interest and costs . This execution had a chequered career . To begin with , the judgment debtors raised 140 an objection that the assignee being a mere benamidar of Durga Prasad Chamria had no locus standi to take out execution . This dispute eventually ended in favour of the assignee after about five years ' fight and it was held that the assignment was bonafide and Keshardeo was not a benamidar of the decree holder . On the 17th July , 1942 , Keshardeo made an application for attachment of various new properties of the judgment debtors and for their arrest . Another set of objections was filed against this application by Radha Kissen Chamria . He disputed the correctness of the decretal amount , and contended that a certain payment of Rs . 1,60,000 should be recorded and certified as made the 28th May , 1934 , and not the date the sum was actually paid to the decreeholer . This objection was decided by the Subordinate Judge the 11th September , 1942 , and it was held that the judgment debtors were liable to pay interest the sum of Rs . 1,60,000 up to the 12th October , 1936 , and not up to the 4th July , 1941 , 'as claimed by the assignee . appeal the High Court by its judgment dated the 22nd June , 1943 , upheld the decree holder 's contention , and ruled that the judgment debtors were liable to pay interest up to the 4th July , 1941 , this sum of Rs . 1,60,000 . The judgment debtors then applied for leave to appeal to the Privy Council against this decision and leave was granted . the 13th February , 1945 , an application wag made to withdraw the appeals , and with ' drawal was allowed by an order of the court dated the 20th February , 1945 . Thus the resistance offered by the judgment debtors to the decree holder 's application of the 17th July , 1942 , ended the 20th February , 1945 .
