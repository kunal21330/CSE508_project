fees were payable by the trading members elected under the Rules and Bylaws of the Association , who alone with their Associates , could transact business in stocks and shares in the Association . Therefore , the body of trading members who paid the entrance fees , and the shareholders among whom the profits were distributed were not identical and thus the element of mutuality was lacking . It is the nature of the business of the company and the profits and the distribution thereof which are the determining factors and in this case it has not been shown that the appellants business was in any way different from that which was carried on in the ( 1 ) ; , 308 . ( 2 ) ; 805 case reported as Liverpool Corn Trade Association vs Monks ( 1 ) . In our opinion the judgment of the High Court is right and the appeals are therefore dismissed with costs . One hearing fee . Appeals dismissed .
